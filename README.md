> **Contribution disclaimer:** Flatris is a web game with an opinionated feature set and architectural design. It doesn't have a roadmap. While I'm generally open to ideas, I would advise against submitting unannounced PRs with new or modified functionality. That said, **bug reports and fixes are most appreciated.**

> **WIP disclaimer:** Flatris has been recently redesigned from the ground up and turned into a multiplayer game with both UI and server components. This has been an interesting journey and I plan to document the architecture in depth. **[Stay tuned](https://twitter.com/skidding)**.

Thanks [@paulgergely](https://twitter.com/paulgergely) for the initial flat design!
